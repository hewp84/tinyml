        "In Lab 2, we will use a digital temperature and humidity sensor, DHT11 module \n",
        "(https://components101.com/sensors/dht11-temperature-sensor, available on Jan. 9, 2022), to measure atmospheric temperature and humidity. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air and splits out a digital signal on the digital pin. It is simple to use but requires careful timing to grab data. The only real downside of this sensor is you can only get new data from it once every 2 seconds. There are many applications using the humidity and temperature sensor, such as HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning), testing and inspection equipment, consumer goods, automotive, automatic control, data loggers, humidity regulator, and so on. \n",

        "Prelab 2 is to prepare the DHT11 module use for Lab 2 and to get familiar with Python. In all lab manuals, Python means Python3 if no further descriptions. We will use Raspberry Pi and Python. Lab manuals will mainly describe the use of ‘Terminal’. However, if you are a beginner of Python, you can also use Thonny IDE, the default software of Raspberry Pi OS 11. If you are interested, visit and follow this tutorial (https://roboticsbackend.com/thonny-ide-raspberry-pi-os/, available on Jan. 9, 2022). "
