        "The topic of Lab7 is SQL database. We will practice using SQL database, specifically MySQL, to collect IIoT data in this lab. Please note that even if SQL is the relational database, we won’t go on a relational database structure because it is out of the scope of this course. In this lab, however, you will learn the basic syntax of SQL and Python programming to aggregate sensor data to MySQL database. Through hands-on activities, you will perform 1) creating a database table, 2) inserting data to the table using SQL, and 3) Python programming to collect data to the database. At the end of this lab, you will make your Raspberry Pi transmit data from sensors (DHT11 and ADXL345) to the database. To focus on SQL in this lab, let’s set aside the use of MTConnect. "
