For the power meter, Modbus protocol will be used. On the other hand, for the CNC controller, TCP/IP (so-called EtherNet/IP) protocol will be used. This prelab is to install a related package on Raspberry Pi and to be familiar with the devices. Modbus is a representative protocol in Fieldbus communications. And TCP/IP is a representative protocol in Industrial Ethernet communications. \n"
