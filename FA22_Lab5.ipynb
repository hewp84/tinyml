        "MTConnect defines the communications and protocols, and it provides the vocabulary and semantics of the information models. MTConnect agent is a form of middleware that provides a service to client applications that require data from specified manufacturing equipment or sensors. The agent needs to receive a stream of data directly from a compliant device or from a software adapter. The data stream is received by the agent and buffered in a circular buffer. Upon request (HTTP) from a client, the agent binds the buffered data to the device data model (device.xml) and provides the appropriate response XML (Extensible Markup Language) document (*.xml). \n",
        "\n",
        "Typical MTConnect architecture is shown in Figure 1. There are 3 different cases of MTConnect architecture. \n",
        "Of course, mixed configurations from each case are applicable. An agent can support multiple machines. Adapters can be provided by the manufacturer of the machine and sensor or developed. In addition, adapter can reside 1) on the machine’s controller, 2) connected to the PLC wires and controller, and 3) remotely if the machine communicates using a network protocol. Applications can only communicate with MTConnect agent. The data streamflow of MTConnect is unidirectional from the device to the application. It means that a client application is based on read-only data from MTConnect agent. MTConnect does not allow to write data to MTConnect agent. We may think of a lot of applications such as real-time web-based monitoring, creating digital twins, and data analytics. Therefore, the applications are differed by demands. \n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of Lab5 is to create a basic MTConnect agent stream in various network configurations and to request MTconnect agent data as a client application. In addition, by simulating MTConnect adapter, we will make data stream for MTConnect agent. \n",

        "In this part, we will change the device data model by modifying ‘Device.xml’. The given device model has 2 data items (id=”a1” and id=”t1”) because id=”avail” is a default EVENT data item for a device. The scenario is to make MTConnect agent (laptop) device data model to collect 3-axis accelerometer (ADXL345, Lab3) data and humidity-temperature sensor (DHT11, Lab2) data from Raspberry Pi. Because the data items are measured vulues, the category must SAMPLE. The device data model schematic is shown in Figure 7.Therefore, your Raspberry Pi will be an MTConnect adapter and your laptop will be an MTConnect agent. Please follow the steps below. \n",

        "We have not discussed details of MTConnect adapter yet. To see the data stream flow of MTConnect agent, however, we will simulate MTConnect adapter. The simulation data (‘Sensor_log.txt’) and simulation adapter (‘run_scenario.rb’) programmed by ruby are on Brightspace. Please download two files on Raspberry Pi. Please note that two files must be in the same directory in this example. The schematic of the simulation is shown in Figure 8. Raspberry Pi will run MTConnect adapter simulator and data streams are transmitted to the MTConnect agent of laptop. The data log file (‘Sensor_log.txt’) using Lab2 and Lab3 codes was created by collecting both ADXL345 sensor data (3-axis accelerations) and DHT11 (humidity and temperature). Two sensors have different sampling frequencies. In this scenario, sampling periods are 1 second and 3 seconds, respectively. The length of simulation data is 3 minutes, but we will simulate repeating the data continuously. The plots of the data are shown in Figure 9.  \n",
