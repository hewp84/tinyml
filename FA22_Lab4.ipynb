        "\n",
        "Nowadays, in Industry 4.0 era, there are a lot of IoT devices and machines available which follow the industry standard communications and protocols. The purpose of Lab 4 is to collect data using industry standard IoT communications and protocols. We will collect data from two devices, 1) a multi-functional power meter and 2) a CNC machine controller, to practice industry IoT communication and data aggregation methods from devices equipped with IoT capabilities. It is not surprising that most, probably every, manufacturing equipment is operated by electrical power. Measuring power consumption plays an important role in operating the machine efficiently. In addition, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) is the automated control of machining tools, such as mills, lathes, 3D printers, laser cutters, and so on. In the manufacturing industry, CNC machines are the most common and widely used machines. Many CNC machines recently released are equipped with IoT capabilities. If we access and read CNC data in real time, we can monitor the machineâ€™s operating status, run-time, downtime, OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) and so on. These kinds of information are useful to determine performance of the machine and enable us to operate shop floor effectively. However, the available information depends on the machine and communication. \n",
        "\n",
        "To monitor the power consumption of a machine, we will use a multi-functional power meter (AccuEnergy, Acuvim-CL-D, https://www.accuenergy.com/products/acuvim-l-multifunction-power-energy-meter/, available on Feb. 3, 2022) and a current transformer (AccuEnergy, AcuCT-H040-5:333, https://www.accuenergy.com/products/acuct-hinged-split-core-current-transformers/, available on Feb. 2, 2022). This power meter is equipped with Modbus RTU protocol via RS485 (serial communication). The power meter and the current transformer are shown in Figure 1. As a target machine of measuring electric power, a single stage vacuum pump (HBS Vacuum Equipment Factory, RS-2, http://www.hbspump.com/oil-vacuumpump/single-stage-vacuum-pump/hbs-vacuum-pump-rs-2-single-stage-oil-havc.html, available on Feb. 3, 2022). The selected specifications of the power meter and the vacuum pump are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The user manual for more information on the power meter is on Brightspace as well. \n",

The vacuum degassing system is used in many manufacturing and chemical industries to degas liquid, paste-like, and moist products. The mini-sized vacuum degassing system for Lab 4 is shown in Figure 4. To make a vacuum environment of it, a vacuum pump sucks out air from the chamber. It takes the standard AC voltage in the US which is 120 VAC (single-phase) 60 Hz.\n",

        "The power meter system and hardware configuration are shown in Figure 5. The power meter is equipped with Modbus RTU communication option. Because Modbus RTU which uses serial communications cannot have multiple masters, we will use Modbus RTU (slave side) to Modbus TCP (master side) converter (MGate MB3180, Moxa, https://www.moxa.com/en/products/industrial-edge-connectivity/protocol-gateways/modbus-tcpgateways/mgate-mb3180-mb3280-mb3480-series#specifications, available on Feb. 2, 2022). The converter allows us to communicate the Modbus RTU device via Modbus TCP. Modbus RTU is limited to a single master with multiple slaves whereas multiple masters and multiple slavesâ€™ configurations are possible if using Modbus TCP. Schematics of Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP are shown in Figure 6. Since Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP share and follow the standard Modbus protocol, it is possible to use converting data each other. In the most industry, Modbus RTU is commonly used due to cost and the reliability of data transmission. The main difference between Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP is mostly in the transport frames or the wrapper around the PDU (Protocol Data Unit). In both forms of Modbus, application specific addressing and error checking are attached to the PDU to make the ADU (Application Data Unit). In Modbus TCP is encapsulated in a TCP packet. The TCP protocol handless the error checking, which is why it is omitted from the Modbus TCP ADU. The comparisons of Modbus data frames are shown in Figure 7. \n",

The figure is the top side view (+z-axis view) from the workpiece. Symbols of the schematic are shown on the right-hand side of the figure. This G-code is cut down the entire face of the workpiece in 10 mm depth with a 5 mm diameter end-mill of the z-axis. From the cutting condition (federate), and tool path, we can calculate how long the G-code takes. The entire will take around 10 minutes 20 seconds. TA will repeat running the same G-code throughout the lab. Even though the machine hardware is not connected to the CNC controller, it runs G-code and simulates the cutting. The purpose of this section is to collect CNC controller data via TCP/IP protocol while the G-code is running. \n",

In this lab, we will use the Wifi of Haas controller to be on the router network. The entire schematic for communication between computers and the CNC controller using TCP/IP is shown in Figure 16. Different from Modbus protocol, the computers are called clients, and the target machine (CNC controller in this case) is called server. It is possible that multiple clients can request the data from a TCP server.

Successful queries return the name of the query, then the requested information, separated by commas. For example, a query of ?Q102 returns MODEL, XXX, where XXX is the machine model. The comma lets you treat the output as comma-separated variable (CSV) data. An unrecognized command returns a question mark followed by the unrecognized command; e.g., ?Q105 returns ?, ?Q105.  \n",
