However, do not throw away the film because you need to reuse the file to protect adhesive so that the double-sided tape remains adhesion for next time use.

The next step is to firmly attach the adhesive putty to one of the blades of the fan. When you attach the adhesive putty, please press holding both the adhesive putty and a blade together firmly for a few seconds as Figure 14 (left). And then assemble the wire guard and the front nuts as Figure 14 (right). Lastly, run the axial flow fan. Can you feel increased vibration? While the fan is running in the abnormal condition, collect and save acceleration data by using ‘lab3_sample4.py’. After finishing all measurements, please remove the attached adhesive putty. Keep the sensor assembly and jumper wires and return these at the end of the semester. It is strongly recommended to play with Raspberry Pi and the ADXL345 sensor.
