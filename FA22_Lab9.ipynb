        "In this lab, we will create a machine learning (ML) model based on the accelerometer (ADXL345) signals to predict the running conditions of the axial flow fan (AFF) which we used in lab 3. An autoencoder we practiced in Prelab9 will be employed to determine whether AFF is in a normal or abnormal condition. Lab9 is broken down into two main sections: 1) Data collection, and 2) Training ML model. In the data collection section, we will collect accelerometer data when the machine is in normal and abnormal conditions using Raspberry Pi. The abnormal condition will be set of increasing eccentric force by adding a mass on a blade of the AFF as Lab3. In the training ML model section, we will utilize the given scripts in Prelab9 to train an autoencoder. In addition, we will perform feature engineering by doing signal processing to see the effects of input feature on the performance of the ML models. And the, we will save the selected and trained model to local disk to use it in the next lab. The schematic of Lab9 is illustrated in Figure 1.\n",

For safety reasons, the base part is fixed on the table using tapes. Do not remove the tapes because it maybe moves when you run the AFF. To turn on the fan, rotate the knob of the speed controller clockwise. The relationship between knob pointer placements and the actual rotational speed of AFF is shown in Table 2. When you rotate the pointer of the knob to L (Speed 1 in Figure 3 (right)), for example, the AFF rotates around 1800 rpm. By adjusting the control knob, you can increase and decrease the rotating speed of the fan. Different from the vacuum pump case of Prelab9, it is obvious that changing rotational speed makes an ML model development hard. On the other hand, it may be more interesting. For instance, if you attached unbalanced mass to a blade of the fan at the lowest rotational speed, does the amplitude of vibration be bigger than the maximum rotational speed without any attached mass? We don’t know and the answer may be no. Try to turn the fan on and adjust the knob to see if the rotation speed changes well. \n",

If you are not sure how to set up the accelerometer to the AFF, please look at Part 7 of Lab3 manual. To collect acceleration data when the machine is in normal conditions for 5 minutes, perform TASK 2. When you collect the data, try to change the rotational speed. For example, while collecting, set Speed 1 (1800 rpm) for the first 1 minute, and then Speed 2 (2150 rpm) between 1 and 2 minutes from the start, and so on. The example of the experimental table is shown in Table 3. You can see the progress of your data collector in the Shell of Thonny or Terminal window of Raspberry Pi as Figure 5. For this, you must perform data collection at once with other members sharing the table and the AFF. \n",
