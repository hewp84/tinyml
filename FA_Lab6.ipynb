In Prelab 6, we programmed an MTConnect adapter using random value generations. In this lab, we will program the MTConnect adapters to collect sensors’ data connected to Raspberry Pi. To be specific, the target sensors are humidity-temperature sensor (DHT11, Lab2), accelerometer (ADXL345, Lab3), and power meter (Acuvim-CL, Lab4). In addition, we will practice more about basic client application, XPath and XML parsing. \n"
